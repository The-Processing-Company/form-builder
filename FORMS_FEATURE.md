# Forms Storage Feature

This feature allows users to save, load, and manage their form designs created in the Form Builder playground.

## Features

### 1. Form Management
- **Create New Forms**: Start building forms from scratch
- **Save Forms**: Automatically save form designs with unique identifiers
- **Edit Forms**: Modify existing forms and save changes
- **Delete Forms**: Remove forms you no longer need
- **Form Metadata**: Track creation date, last modified, and field count

### 2. Storage
- **Local Storage**: All forms are stored locally in the browser using localStorage
- **No Account Required**: Works completely offline without user registration
- **Persistent**: Forms persist across browser sessions

### 3. Navigation
- **URL-based**: Each form has a unique URL (e.g., `/playground/form_123`)
- **Editable Names**: Form names can be changed without affecting the URL
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Easy navigation between forms list and individual forms

### 4. Import/Export
- **Export Forms**: Download forms as JSON files
- **Import Forms**: Upload previously exported forms
- **Share Forms**: Share form designs with others via JSON files

## Usage

### Creating a New Form
1. Navigate to `/forms` or `/playground`
2. Click "New Form" or "Create New Form"
3. Give your form a name and optional description
4. Start building your form in the playground

### Editing an Existing Form
1. Go to `/forms` to see all your forms
2. Click "Edit" on any form card
3. Make changes in the playground
4. Click "Save" to persist your changes

### Managing Forms
- **Search**: Use the search bar to find specific forms
- **Sort**: Forms are automatically sorted by last modified date
- **Delete**: Remove unwanted forms (action cannot be undone)

## Technical Implementation

### Storage Layer
- Uses `FormStorage` class for localStorage operations
- Generates unique IDs for each form
- Handles CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

### Routing
- Dynamic routes: `/playground/[formId]`
- Special route: `/playground/new` for creating new forms
- Forms page: `/forms` for managing all forms

### State Management
- Form data is managed locally in each component
- Changes trigger save prompts
- Unsaved changes are tracked and displayed

## File Structure
